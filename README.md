## Description
CryptoKeeper is a cryptocurrency tracking application using real-time market data via Socket.IO. The current cryptocurrencies tend be quite volatile compared to more traditional currencies and stocks with prices sometimes dropping or increasing drastically in a matter of hours. By registering for an account, users can overcome the uncertaintity of keeping up with the market by creating custom events to monitor a given currency for a specific condition.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 (e.g. Bitcoin just reached $12k, Ethereum dropped 5%) 
 
 If and when a condition is eventually met, a notification will be sent to the user by text message and/or email indicating the current price. User's have control over each event condition as well as the method of deilvery and custom message that will be displayed with the notification.
